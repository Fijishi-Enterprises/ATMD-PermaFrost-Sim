# Globsim

Welcome to Globsim, a framework for working with multiple global reanalyses on the same grid. GlobSim is a Python (version 3.7) software package designed to download and process important global atmospheric reanalyses and to derive time series with consistent variables, units and time intervals for specific locations. It comprises three parts. (1) Downloading for retrieving original data. (2) Interpolation of original, gridded variables to point locations as time-series. (3) Scaling of site-level time-series to common units and temporal resolution, and possibly, the application of additional, empirical downscaling function. Full desciption available in this publication: GMDD WITH URL.
